Chrome Bookmarks
================

Chrome Bookmarks is a browser extension to batch push bookmarks to reader services like instapaper or pocket.

## Requirements
At the moment there is no API integration with pocket or instapaper, but when there is, you will need your own API tokens/credentials to make use of this code.
