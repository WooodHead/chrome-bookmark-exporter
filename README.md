Chrome Bookmark Exporter
================

Chrome Bookmark Exporter is a chrome browser extension to batch export bookmarks to text, html or 
reader services like instapaper or pocket.

## Requirements
At the moment there is no API integration with pocket or instapaper, but when there is, you will need your 
own API tokens/credentials to make use of this code.
